long_indicator_description$en$text,"Women teachers are women whose professional activity is student instruction, involving the delivery of lessons to students. The indicator measures the proportion of women of all teachers and instructors. In many countries, there is a 'leaky pipeline' phenomenon, meaning that the proportion of women decreases as they move up the tertiary education career ladder. A low proportion of women in instructor positions may point to structural inequalities. Nevertheless, this indicator does not contain any information about the proportion of women entering tertiary education. ",,

long_indicator_description$de$text,"Der Anteil der Lehrerinnen und Dozentinen misst, wie viele Frauen im tertiären Bildungsbereich eines Landes unterrichten. In vielen Ländern gibt es ein 'Leaky Pipeline' Phänomen: obwohl mehr Frauen als Männer mit dem Studium beginnen, dünnt sich der Anteil entlang der Hochschulkarriereleiter aus. Ein geringer Frauenanteil weist so auf eine strukturelle Ungleichheit hin. Allerdings enthält dieser Indikator alleine keine Informationen darüber, wie viele eine Tertiärausbildung beginnen.  ",,
